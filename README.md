# SelfDrivingCar
We trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) to map raw pixels from a single front-facing camera directly to steering commands. With minimum training data from humans, the system learns to drive in presence of other cars with broken or solid lane markings on a track. Our toy scale self-driving car also recognizes different road signs using haar cascade classifier.
